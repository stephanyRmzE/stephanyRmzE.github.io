      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I am a mechatronic engineer with 5 years of experience on machine coding. I have always love coding, the challenges it imposes and seeing the final product gives me a great feeling of accomplishment. I am a knowledge seeker and that made me good at find different ways of problem solving. I decided to change the my line of work because even if I was still coding I was missing something I felt it was too rigid.
That’s the reason why I decided to do Le Wagon's Web Development bootcamp, and since the beginning I felt that I got what I was missing, I love the more interactive part, and doing things you cannot belief possible.</p>
